# rasberry_pi_images
This is a repository for some pi images.


The open_cv image is just jessie with python and opencv installed. I also have some other random stuff on there,but this is a working distro of pi with opencv. Git dose not like big files so here is a Dropbox link https://www.dropbox.com/s/ksnb82lzl6qmz7c/jessie_opencv.dmg.zip?dl=0

Just install on sd as normal.
